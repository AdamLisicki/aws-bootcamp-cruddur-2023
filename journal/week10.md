  - VPC
    - sets DNS hostnames for EC2 instances
    - Only IPV4, IPV6 is disabled
  - InternetGateway
  - Route Table
    - route to the IGW
    - route to Local
  - 6 Subnets Explicity Associated to Route Table
    - 3 Public Subnets numbered 1 to 3
    - 3 Private Subnets numbered 1 to 3

config.toml file.
```
[deploy]
bucket = 'cfn-artifacts-cruddur'
region = 'us-east-1'
stack_name = 'CrdNet'
```

```

1. SubnetPub1, SubnetPub2, SubnetPub3 (Public Subnets):

   - These sections define three resources of type AWS::EC2::Subnet, representing public subnets within the VPC.
   - The VpcId property is set to the logical reference !Ref VPC, which means these subnets will be associated with the VPC identified by the logical name "VPC".
   - The CidrBlock property is set using the !Select function to retrieve specific CIDR blocks from the SubnetCidrBlocks parameter. For example, !Select [0, !Ref SubnetCidrBlocks] selects the first CIDR block in the list. Each subnet uses a different CIDR block.
   - The AvailabilityZone property is set using the !Select function to retrieve specific Availability Zones (AZs) from the AvailabilityZones parameter. For example, !Select [0, !Ref AvailabilityZones] selects the first AZ in the list. Each subnet is associated with a different AZ.
   - The EnableDns64 property is set to false, indicating that DNS IPv6 resolution is disabled for these subnets.
   - The MapPublicIpOnLaunch property is set to true, enabling instances launched in these subnets to automatically receive a public IP address.
   - The Tags property is used to specify tags for the subnets. Each subnet has a single tag with the key "Name" and the value is dynamically generated using the !Sub function with the format "${AWS::StackName}SubnetPubX", where X represents the number of the subnet.

2. SubnetPriv1, SubnetPriv2, SubnetPriv3 (Private Subnets):

   - These sections define three resources of type AWS::EC2::Subnet, representing private subnets within the VPC.
   - The properties of these subnets are similar to the public subnets, except for a few differences:
       - The MapPublicIpOnLaunch property is set to false, meaning instances launched in these subnets will not receive a public IP address by default.
       - The Tags property follows the same pattern as the public subnets, generating a name based on the stack name and the subnet number.

  - "Conditions" specify the conditions that need to be met for the rule to apply. In this case, the condition is based on the host header value. The rule will apply if the host header matches "api.cruddur.pl".
  - "Actions" define the action to be taken when the rule matches. In this case, the action is set to forward the request to the target group referenced by BackendTG.
  - "ListenerArn" references the HTTPS listener (HTTPSListener) to which this rule should be associated.
  - "Priority" sets the priority of the rule. A lower number indicates a higher priority. In this case, the priority is set to 1.

This CloudFormation (CFN) code creates a security group (SG) for an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

The properties of the security group are configured as follows:
  - "GroupName" is set using the !Sub function, which substitutes the "${AWS::StackName}AlbSG" expression with the name of the CloudFormation stack followed by "AlbSG".
  - "GroupDescription" provides a description for the security group, indicating that it is a public-facing SG for the Cruddur ALB.
  - "VpcId" references the VPC ID obtained from an imported value called "${NetworkingStack}VpcId".
  - "SecurityGroupIngress" specifies the inbound traffic rules for the security group. Two rules are defined:
  - The first rule allows inbound traffic on TCP port 443 (HTTPS) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).
  - The second rule allows inbound traffic on TCP port 80 (HTTP) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0).

This CloudFormation (CFN) code creates two target groups for an Application Load Balancer (ALB): "BackendTG" and "FrontendTG". 

1. "BackendTG" target group:
      - It defines a resource of type AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup.
      - The properties of the target group are configured as follows:
      - "Name" is set using the !Sub function, which substitutes the "${AWS::StackName}BackendTG" expression with the name of the CloudFormation stack followed by "BackendTG".
      - "Port" specifies the port that the target group listens on, obtained from the BackendPort parameter.
      - "HealthCheckProtocol" specifies the protocol used for health checks, obtained from the BackendHealthCheckProtocol parameter.
      - "HealthCheckEnabled" is set to true, indicating that health checks are enabled for the target group.
      - Various health check properties such as interval, path, port, timeout, healthy threshold count, and unhealthy threshold count are obtained from respective parameters.
      - "IpAddressType" is set to "ipv4" to use IPv4 addresses.
      - "Matcher" is configured to match HTTP response code 200.
      - "Protocol" is set to HTTP and "ProtocolVersion" is set to HTTP2.
      - "TargetGroupAttributes" specify additional attributes for the target group. In this case, a deregistration delay timeout of 0 seconds is set.
      - "VpcId" references the VPC ID obtained from an imported value called "${NetworkingStack}VpcId".
 
2. "FrontendTG" target group:
      - It defines a resource of type AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup similar to "BackendTG".
      - The properties are configured in a similar way, but with values obtained from respective Frontend prefixed parameters.
