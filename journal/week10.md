    Type: CommaDelimitedList
    Default: >
      us-east-1a,
      us-east-1b,
      us-east-1c
  SubnetCidrBlocks:
    Description: "Comma-delimited list of CIDR blocks for subnets"
    Type: CommaDelimitedList
    Default: > 
      10.0.0.0/22, 
      10.0.4.0/22, 
      10.0.8.0/22,

```

 - AvailabilityZones: This parameter allows you to specify a list of Availability Zones (AZs) where your AWS resources will be deployed. 
                      The default value suggests three AZs: us-east-1a, us-east-1b, and us-east-1c.
                      
 - SubnetCidrBlocks: This parameter allows you to specify a list of CIDR blocks for your subnets.
                     The default value suggests six CIDR blocks: 10.0.0.0/22, 10.0.4.0/22, 10.0.8.0/22, 10.0.12.0/22, 10.0.16.0/22, and 10.0.20.0/22.
                     
 - VPCCidrBlock: This parameter allows you to specify the CIDR block for your VPC.
                 Default value is set to 10.0.0.0/16, which suggests a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16. 


```
Resources:
  VPC: 
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: !Ref VPCCidrBlock
      EnableDnsHostnames: true
      EnableDnsSupport: true
      InstanceTenancy: default
      Tags:
        - Key: Name 
          Value: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}VPC"
```

- The resource is defined with the logical name "VPC".
- The resource properties are specified under the "Properties" section.
- The "CidrBlock" property is set using the !Ref function with the parameter "VPCCidrBlock". This means that the CIDR block for the VPC is dynamically determined based on the value provided for the "VPCCidrBlock" parameter during the stack deployment.
- The "EnableDnsHostnames" property is set to true, enabling DNS hostnames for the VPC.
- The "EnableDnsSupport" property is set to true, enabling DNS resolution for the VPC.
- The "InstanceTenancy" property is set to "default", indicating that instances launched within this VPC will have the default tenancy, which means they run on shared hardware.
- The "Tags" property is used to specify tags for the VPC resource. In this case, a single tag is defined with the key "Name" and the value is dynamically generated using the !Sub function with the format "${AWS::StackName}VPC". The ${AWS::StackName} variable refers to the name of the CloudFormation stack in which the VPC resource is being created.


```
  IGW:
    Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
    Properties:
      Tags: 
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}IGW"

  AttachIGW:    
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment
    Properties: 
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      InternetGatewayId: !Ref IGW
```

1. Internet Gateway (IGW):
     - This section defines a resource named IGW of type AWS::EC2::InternetGateway.
     - The Tags property is used to specify tags for the Internet Gateway. In this case, a single tag is defined with the key "Name" and the value is dynamically generated using the !Sub function with the format "${AWS::StackName}IGW". The ${AWS::StackName} variable refers to the name of the CloudFormation stack in        which the Internet Gateway resource is being created.
     -
2. VPC Gateway Attachment (AttachIGW):
     - This section defines a resource named AttachIGW of type AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment. A VPC Gateway Attachment is used to attach an Internet Gateway to a VPC.
     - The VpcId property is set to the logical reference !Ref VPC, which means the attachment will be made to the VPC identified by the logical name "VPC".
     - The InternetGatewayId property is set to the logical reference !Ref IGW, which means the attachment will be made to the Internet Gateway identified by the logical name "IGW".



```
  RouteTable:
    Type: AWS::EC2::RouteTable
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      Tags: 
        - Key: Name
          Value: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}RT"

  RouteToIGW:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Route
    DependsOn: AttachIGW
    Properties:
      RouteTableId: !Ref RouteTable
      GatewayId: !Ref IGW
      DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
```

1. Route Table (RouteTable):
   -  This section defines a resource named RouteTable of type AWS::EC2::RouteTable.
   -  The VpcId property is set to the logical reference !Ref VPC, which means the route table will be associated with the VPC identified by the logical name "VPC".
   -  The Tags property is used to specify tags for the Route Table. In this case, a single tag is defined with the key "Name" and the value is dynamically generated using the !Sub function with the format "${AWS::StackName}RT". The ${AWS::StackName} variable refers to the name of the CloudFormation stack in which         the Route Table resource is being created.
   
2. Route to an Internet Gateway (RouteToIGW):
   -  This section defines a resource named RouteToIGW of type AWS::EC2::Route. This resource is used to add a route to the Route Table created in the previous section, directing traffic to an Internet Gateway.
   -  The DependsOn property specifies that this resource depends on the successful creation of the AttachIGW resource.
   -  The RouteTableId property is set to the logical reference !Ref RouteTable, which means the route will be added to the Route Table identified by the logical name "RouteTable".
   -  The GatewayId property is set to the logical reference !Ref IGW, which means the traffic will be routed to the Internet Gateway identified by the logical name "IGW".
   -  The DestinationCidrBlock property is set to 0.0.0.0/0, which represents the default route for all traffic (any IP address). This route directs all traffic to the specified Internet Gateway.

```

1. SubnetPub1, SubnetPub2, SubnetPub3 (Public Subnets):

   - These sections define three resources of type AWS::EC2::Subnet, representing public subnets within the VPC.
   - The VpcId property is set to the logical reference !Ref VPC, which means these subnets will be associated with the VPC identified by the logical name "VPC".
   - The CidrBlock property is set using the !Select function to retrieve specific CIDR blocks from the SubnetCidrBlocks parameter. For example, !Select [0, !Ref SubnetCidrBlocks] selects the first CIDR block in the list. Each subnet uses a different CIDR block.
   - The AvailabilityZone property is set using the !Select function to retrieve specific Availability Zones (AZs) from the AvailabilityZones parameter. For example, !Select [0, !Ref AvailabilityZones] selects the first AZ in the list. Each subnet is associated with a different AZ.
   - The EnableDns64 property is set to false, indicating that DNS IPv6 resolution is disabled for these subnets.
   - The MapPublicIpOnLaunch property is set to true, enabling instances launched in these subnets to automatically receive a public IP address.
   - The Tags property is used to specify tags for the subnets. Each subnet has a single tag with the key "Name" and the value is dynamically generated using the !Sub function with the format "${AWS::StackName}SubnetPubX", where X represents the number of the subnet.

2. SubnetPriv1, SubnetPriv2, SubnetPriv3 (Private Subnets):

   - These sections define three resources of type AWS::EC2::Subnet, representing private subnets within the VPC.
   - The properties of these subnets are similar to the public subnets, except for a few differences:
       - The MapPublicIpOnLaunch property is set to false, meaning instances launched in these subnets will not receive a public IP address by default.
       - The Tags property follows the same pattern as the public subnets, generating a name based on the stack name and the subnet number.

   - The RouteTableId property is set to the logical reference !Ref RouteTable, which means the association will be made with the route table identified by the logical name "RouteTable".

2. SubnetPriv1RTAssociation, SubnetPriv2RTAssociation, SubnetPriv3RTAssociation (Associations for Private Subnets):

   - These sections define three resources of type AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation, representing the association between private subnets and a route table.
