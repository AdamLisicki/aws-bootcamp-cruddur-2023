  RDSPostgresSG:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupName: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}RDSSG"
      GroupDescription: Public Facing SG for our Cruddur ALB
      VpcId:
        Fn::ImportValue:
          !Sub ${NetworkingStack}VpcId
      SecurityGroupIngress:

          FromPort: 5432
          ToPort: 5432
          Description: ALB HTTP
```

This CloudFormation template code defines a resource named "RDSPostgresSG", which is an AWS EC2 security group.

- "GroupName": It sets the name of the security group using the !Sub function, which substitutes variables with their corresponding values. In this case, ${AWS::StackName} represents the name of the CloudFormation stack, and "RDSSG" is appended to it.

- "GroupDescription": It provides a description for the security group, stating that it is a public-facing security group for the "Cruddur" Application Load Balancer (ALB).

- "VpcId": It specifies the VPC ID for the security group. The !Sub function is used along with Fn::ImportValue to import the value of ${NetworkingStack}VpcId from another CloudFormation stack. This allows the security group to be associated with the VPC defined in the "NetworkingStack" stack.

- "SecurityGroupIngress": It defines the ingress rules for the security group, specifying the inbound traffic allowed. In this case, there is a single ingress rule defined:

- "IpProtocol": It sets the protocol to TCP.

- "SourceSecurityGroupId": It uses the Fn::ImportValue function along with !Sub to import the value of ${ClusterStack}ServiceSecurityGroupId from another CloudFormation stack. This means that the security group allows incoming traffic from the security group associated with the service defined in the "ClusterStack" stack.

- "FromPort" and "ToPort": They define the range of ports allowed for the inbound traffic. In this case, it is port 5432, which is commonly used for PostgreSQL database connections.

- "Description": It provides a description for the ingress rule, stating that it allows ALB HTTP traffic

  DBSubnetGroup:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBSubnetGroup
    Properties:
      DBSubnetGroupName: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}DBSubnetGroup"
      DBSubnetGroupDescription: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}DBSubnetGroup"
      SubnetIds: { 'Fn::Split' : [ ','  , { "Fn::ImportValue": { "Fn::Sub": "${NetworkingStack}PublicSubnetIds" }}] }
```

This CloudFormation template code defines a resource named "DBSubnetGroup" of type "AWS::RDS::DBSubnetGroup".

The "DBSubnetGroup" resource is used to create a subnet group for an Amazon RDS database. A subnet group is a collection of subnets in a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) that can be used for deploying a multi-AZ (Availability Zone) RDS database.

- "DBSubnetGroupName": It sets the name of the DB subnet group using the !Sub function. The ${AWS::StackName} represents the name of the CloudFormation stack, and "DBSubnetGroup" is appended to it. This ensures that the subnet group has a unique name based on the stack name.

- "DBSubnetGroupDescription": It provides a description for the DB subnet group using the !Sub function. The ${AWS::StackName} represents the name of the CloudFormation stack, and the same value is used as the description. Again, this ensures a unique description based on the stack name.

- "SubnetIds": It specifies the subnet IDs that should be included in the subnet group. The Fn::Split function is used along with Fn::ImportValue and Fn::Sub to split and import the subnet IDs from another CloudFormation stack. The ${NetworkingStack}PublicSubnetIds represents the exported value of subnet IDs from the "NetworkingStack" stack. The subnet IDs are split using the comma (',') delimiter.

- "DBInstanceIdentifier": It references the value of the parameter "DBInstanceIdentifier" using the !Ref function. The value of this parameter specifies the unique identifier for the database instance.

- "DBName": It references the value of the parameter "DBName" using the !Ref function. The value of this parameter specifies the name of the database.

- "DBSubnetGroupName": It references the value of the resource "DBSubnetGroup" using the !Ref function. The value of this parameter specifies the DB subnet group to associate with the database instance, ensuring it is deployed in the specified subnets.

- "DeletionProtection": It references the value of the parameter "DeletionProtection" using the !Ref function. The value of this parameter specifies whether deletion protection should be enabled for the database instance.

- "EnablePerformanceInsights": It enables the performance insights feature for the database instance, allowing monitoring and analysis of database performance.

- "Engine": It specifies the database engine to use. In this case, "postgres" is used, indicating PostgreSQL.

- "EngineVersion": It references the value of the parameter "EngineVersion" using the !Ref function. The value of this parameter specifies the version of the database engine to use.

- "MasterUsername" and "MasterUserPassword": These properties reference the values of the parameters "MasterUsername" and "MasterUserPassword" using the !Ref function. These parameters provide the username and password for the master user of the database instance.

- "PubliclyAccessible": It sets whether the database instance is publicly accessible. In this case, it is set to true, allowing access from the internet.

- "VPCSecurityGroups": It specifies the security groups to associate with the database instance. In this case, it uses the !GetAtt function to retrieve the GroupId attribute of the "RDSPostgresSG" resource, which represents the security group created earlier. This allows the database instance to be associated with the security group.

```
Parameters:
  GitHubBranch:
    Type: String
    Default: prod
  GithubRepo:
    Type: String
    Default: 'AdamLisicki/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023'
  ClusterStack:
    Type: String
  ServiceStack:
    Type: String
  ArtifactBucketName:
    Type: String
```

- GitHubBranch: This parameter is of type string and has a default value of "prod". It is used to specify the branch name of a GitHub repository. By default, it assumes the branch to be "prod".

- GithubRepo: This parameter is of type string and has a default value of 'AdamLisicki/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023'. It represents the name of the GitHub repository that contains the source code for the application or infrastructure being deployed. The default value indicates the repository "aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023" owned by the user "AdamLisicki".

- ClusterStack: This parameter is of type string. It is used to specify the name or identifier of an existing AWS CloudFormation stack that represents an ECS cluster. The ECS cluster is a logical group of EC2 instances running Docker containers.

- ServiceStack: This parameter is of type string. It is used to specify the name or identifier of an existing AWS CloudFormation stack that represents an ECS service. The ECS service manages and deploys the Docker containers on the ECS cluster.

- ArtifactBucketName: This parameter is of type string. It is used to specify the name of an S3 bucket where deployment artifacts or files are stored. The artifacts could include compiled code, configuration files, or any other files required for the deployment.

```
Resources:
  CodeBuildBakeImageStack:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    Properties:
      TemplateURL: nested/codebuild.yaml
  CodeStarConnection:
    Type: AWS::CodeStarConnections::Connection
    Properties:
      ConnectionName: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-connection
      ProviderType: GitHub
```

This CloudFormation (CFN) template creates two AWS resources:

- CodeBuildBakeImageStack: This resource creates an AWS CloudFormation stack using the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource type. It deploys a nested CloudFormation stack using the template specified by the TemplateURL property, which is set to "nested/codebuild.yaml". The "nested/codebuild.yaml" template likely contains the configuration for an AWS CodeBuild project that builds an image or artifact for your application.

- CodeStarConnection: This resource creates an AWS CodeStar Connections connection using the AWS::CodeStarConnections::Connection resource type. It establishes a connection between AWS CodeStar and a version control system, in this case, GitHub. The ConnectionName property uses the !Sub intrinsic function to substitute ${AWS::StackName}-connection, where ${AWS::StackName} represents the name of the current CloudFormation stack. This ensures that each connection created will have a unique name based on the stack name. The ProviderType property is set to "GitHub" to specify that the connection is for a GitHub repository.

                    !Sub ${ServiceStack}ServiceName
```

This CloudFormation (CFN) code creates an AWS CodePipeline pipeline.

- ArtifactStore: This section defines the artifact store for the pipeline. It specifies that the artifacts will be stored in an S3 bucket, and the bucket name is referenced by the ArtifactBucketName parameter.

- RoleArn: This property specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that CodePipeline will assume to perform pipeline actions. It uses the !GetAtt intrinsic function to get the ARN of the CodePipelineRole.

- Stages: This section defines the stages of the pipeline. A pipeline typically consists of one or more stages, and each stage contains one or more actions.
    - Source stage: This stage is responsible for retrieving the source code from a version control system, in this case, GitHub. The ApplicationSource action is configured to connect to the GitHub repository specified by GithubRepo parameter. The ConnectionArn property references the CodeStar connection created           earlier. The source code is stored as a Source output artifact.

    - Build stage: This stage is responsible for building the application or creating a container image. The BuildContainerImage action uses AWS CodeBuild to build the project. The ProjectName property references the CodeBuildBakeImageStack.Outputs.CodeBuildProjectName output from the CodeBuildBakeImageStack stack         created earlier. The source artifact from the previous stage is used as the input artifact, and the output artifact is named ImageDefinition.

    - Deploy stage: This stage is responsible for deploying the application or the container image. The Deploy action deploys the image to an ECS cluster. The cluster name and service name are obtained from the ClusterStack and ServiceStack stacks respectively using the Fn::ImportValue function.

This CloudFormation (CFN) code creates an IAM role named CodePipelineRole. The role is used by AWS CodePipeline to perform various actions within the pipeline.

- AssumeRolePolicyDocument: This section defines the policy that specifies who can assume this IAM role. In this case, the codepipeline.amazonaws.com service is allowed to assume the role. This means that CodePipeline is granted permission to assume this role and perform actions on behalf of this role.

- Path: This property sets the path for the IAM role to "/". The path is a way to organize and manage IAM resources.

- Policies: This section defines the policies attached to the IAM role. The role has multiple policies with different sets of permissions:

    - EcsDeployPolicy: This policy allows permissions for ECS-related actions such as describing services, task definitions, tasks, listing tasks, registering task definitions, and updating services. The Resource: "*" statement allows these actions on all ECS resources.

    - CodeStarPolicy: This policy allows permission to use the CodeStar Connections connection. The Resource property references the CodeStar connection created earlier.

    - CodePipelinePolicy: This policy grants various permissions related to CodePipeline, CloudFormation, IAM, S3, and CloudWatch Logs. It allows actions such as managing S3 buckets (s3:*), creating and managing CloudFormation stacks (cloudformation:*), managing IAM roles (iam:*), and creating and managing                 CloudWatch Logs (logs:*). The Resource: '*' statement allows these actions on all resources.

    - CodePipelineBuildPolicy: This policy grants permission for CodeBuild-related actions. It allows starting, stopping, retrying builds, and getting information about builds in CodeBuild. The Resource property references the specific CodeBuild project using the CodeBuildBakeImageStack.Outputs.CodeBuildProjectName       output.

Parameters

```
Parameters:
  CertificateArn:
    Type: String
  WwwBucketName:
    Type: String
  RootBucketName:
    Type: String
```

- CertificateArn: This parameter is of type string. It is used to specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an SSL/TLS certificate. The certificate is typically associated with a domain or subdomain and is used for securing HTTPS connections. The certificate ARN can be obtained from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Certificate Store.

- WwwBucketName: This parameter is of type string. It is used to specify the name of an S3 bucket that will be used for hosting the content of the "www" subdomain. The "www" subdomain is often used as a canonical version of a website's domain name. For example, if the domain name is "example.com", the "www.example.com" subdomain can be associated with this bucket to serve the website content.

- RootBucketName: This parameter is of type string. It is used to specify the name of an S3 bucket that will be used for hosting the content of the root domain. The root domain refers to the main domain without any subdomains. For example, if the domain name is "example.com", this bucket can be associated with it to serve the website content directly from the root domain.
